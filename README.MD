## Description

This solution uses the `v-bind.sync` feature to split up the object in multiple props, each of which is updated from the child component using the union of get-set computed properties and the `update:prop` pattern.

## When to use

Use it when the object has low-medium size and a fine-grained control over each property is requested.
